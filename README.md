# What is it?

Plunge Proxy is a fast proxy based on the [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet) backend.

## Basic Guide
As stated above, this proxy is based on the ultraviolet backend until it is possible to create and develop a custom backend. If you'd like to work on a backend, please DM Potatoesarefrenchfries#4351 on discord.


```bash
$ cd Ultraviolet-Node
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Usage
To use the proxy, simply click on the search box (located around the center of the screen) and type in the URL of the website you wish to visit. If you don't know the URL, simply input whatever you want and press enter, and it will take you to the google page relating to that subject.
